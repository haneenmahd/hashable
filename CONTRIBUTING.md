# Contributing 🚀
Well, I have a few requirements and acknowledgments before you start contributing to our Project.

## Design
I am a great promoter of a better website with a good UX Design.
 -  🛠 Maintain the User's Experience, without leaving great ideas 💡 and features behind.
 - 🎗 Add animations to enhance the user interface and make users love our service.
 - ❤️ Have your name scribbled on our site's contributors list.
 
 ## Goal
 Our goal is to provide a client-side cryptography service by using node.js as a backend solution.
 Users can create a custom cryptography environment and play along with different kind of hashing methods.
 They can also use our REST API, rather than building a custom function or a server to use a hashing method.
 
 Anyway, you should come up with your idea 💡 in the issues tab.
 
 Good Luck 🤞
